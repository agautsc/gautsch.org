WordPress and SquareSpace and other camel cased companies have eaten the bottom the web market. For the most part, it's for the better. However, if you're looking to play around with web tech and want to see how websites can be blazing fast when not weighed down with plugins and overwrought templates give a static site generator a try.

The most famous has to be [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com "We live in a world where even the GitHub pages site doesn't have a top navigation. Scroll. We all must scroll") powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/ "Delightfully old school design"). I spun up a [couple](https://dalemurphywasthegreatestbaseballplayerofthe1980s.com "Best domain name. Not the best website.") [of](https://bit.ly/atdc-slack "My favorite design.") [those](https://argattheatdc.com/ "I miss writing title tags for links.") sites over last couple years. It's easy and hosting is free.

Recently, I wanted to see what else was out there and gave [Hugo](https://gohugo.io "Oh, oh Hugo") a shot. Hugo runs on a different tech stack than Jekyll, but you can also host it on GitHub pages.

It's fast and fairly easy to pick up. If you're so inclined, give it a [go](https://go.dev/ "Code pun!").
