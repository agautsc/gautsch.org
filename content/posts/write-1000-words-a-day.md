Write 1,000 words a day.

Giving growth and marketing advice to the earliest stage startups is tough. So many things need to be done that it's almost impossible to focus. Lack of team, time, and money overwhelms the mind quickly.

I've noodled on what a good, simple, and achievable heuristic could be. The best I've got is to write 1,000 words a day.

That's not internal emails or Slack message words. That's 1,000 public-facing words. Blog posts, LinkedIn comments, introductory emails, scripts for videos you produce, etc. If you can get to five digits of words a day I think you're doing something.

Is this a good idea? Is it achievable?
