Not in the first week, but probably the first year. If I had a time machine that allowed me to go back in time I would stop by id Software during the making of Quake and ILM from the beginning until the opening of Star Wars.

The creativity and ingenuity of those two culture changing companies is inspiring.

Since a time machine that goes backwards is almost certainly impossible the best I can do is listen to a five hour podcast with [John Carmack](https://lexfridman.com/john-carmack/ "Link to Lex Fridman website") and watch a six hour documentary about [ILM](https://www.disneyplus.com/series/light-magic/3OtlwhtW6Z7E "Link to Light & Magic website on Disney plus").

I can recommend both.
