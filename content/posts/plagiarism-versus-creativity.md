Copying from a competitor is plagiarism. Copying from a different genre is creativity.

I always slap my head when reading, say, an executive summary that's being submitted to a competition and reads like every other executive summary.

Why not stand out? Find inspiration NOT from other executive summaries, but from a short-story or a great recipe or a movie.

You can still copy, err be inspired, by others work. Just not your competitors.
