If the Declaration of Independence was a Power Point the United States would still be a British colony.

I know both startups and big corporates run on slide decks. I don't understand. The Declaration of Independence is 1,320 words. In 1,320 words the inspiration and the case for starting a new country was made.

Folks can't spend the time to write or read 1,320 words to make the case for a startup or a new project inside of a company? You're that busy?

You'll read 1,320 words in one scroll through LinkedIn. I say give it a shot. For fun, see if you can write a Declaration of your business in 1,320 words.
