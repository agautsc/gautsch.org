I saw my friend David Carpenter last week. Years ago, he gave me a simple piece of sales advice that I share once a week with someone.

I figured I share it here.

I had a Jeep with a fried electrical system. It needed real work. Someone was interested in buying it and I asked Dave if $750 was a good price.

His answer, "well, you can't negotiate up."
