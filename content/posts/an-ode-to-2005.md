For reason that are unimportant, I was reading some old blog posts of mine from 2005.

The number of websites that I linked to back then that are no longer around is crazy. Over 75% I'd say. Back then, I thought these sites would never die and they would be the new institutions. I was wrong. Things change and links rarely get redirected.

Side note, I hated Apple with a real passion back then. That passion waned over the years. Melissa won a HomePod Mini at work last week. This stupid speaker doesn't work with Android or Spotify or Bluetooth. The hatred is back!
