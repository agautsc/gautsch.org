"Take a right instead of a left."

The useless directions I provided to Melissa this weekend.

There were seven turns before this turn. I counted. In my mind, I already moved through those obvious turns and was already at the only turn in question.

I find myself giving similar directions when talking about strategy. After thinking about something deeply, I find myself providing answers only to the problems in question. This doesn't help people who aren't in the room. Taking people on the complete journey might take a little extra time upfront, but it saves hours or years of confusion down the road.
