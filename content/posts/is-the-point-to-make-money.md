"Well, the main point is to make money."

It was a response I got some genius thing I said yesterday.

I nodded and we went along with our conversation. Upon further reflection I think this what I wish I would have said.

"Then get a job at 'big company x in your industry' or, heaven forbid, Wall Street. If there isn't a passion beyond money I don't know why you'd work for an early stage startup. It's too hard and the chances for a big win are too low. Working to solve a hard problem and provide real and new value to people is a motivating factor that will keep you going."
